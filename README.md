# spt4_masks
spt4 mask generation code


To use this code:

1. update the settings.py file to the correct set of settings from the settings_files folder
2. run either the ANL liftoff or the UC mask creation files

Don't change any other files.

Note: If you want a gds, you'll need to comment out the quick plotting and comment in the write gds line at the end of your mask creation file

TLS masks are a whole different setup. They'll probably be added as a project when I figure out how to do that.
